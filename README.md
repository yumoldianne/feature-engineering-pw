# ðŸ’³ Client Intelligence Feature Engineering Framework for BPI Private Wealth 

This project aims to design and implement a robust feature engineering framework to extract actionable insights from transactional and behavioral data, supporting the strategic goals of the bank's Private Wealth division. By systematically deriving high-quality features from client activity patterns, the initiative seeks to:

- Validate and refine client segmentation models by revealing latent behaviors and financial habits not captured by current profiles.
- Identify potential high-value clients based on inferred wealth potential, lifestyle indicators, and product engagement patterns.
- Detect early warning signs of client disengagement through temporal and behavioral trend analysis.
- Enable data-driven personalization by constructing features that represent individual preferences, brand affinities, and communication channel tendencies.

The project will leverage advanced techniques in data transformation, clustering, and predictive modeling to engineer interpretable and high-impact variables. These engineered features will serve as foundational inputs to downstream machine learning models, client intelligence dashboards, and targeted marketing initiatives, thereby enhancing decision-making across the Private Wealth lifecycle.
